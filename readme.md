This Python script is designed to analyze and score Valorant games played. Its a part of a system that scores based on various metrics and weights, and then writes the results to a CSV file. This backend system provides a quantitative way to evaluate player performance and game outcomes. Was going to use a system like this for a automated uploader of pro vods but realized that it didnt have that much of a value since it pretty much matched what other vod channels did.
